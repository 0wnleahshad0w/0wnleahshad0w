  Musician turned digital investigator. Self-taught, evidence-driven, and documenting everything.

I'm someone who's spent most of my life as a working musician ‚Äî but recently, I‚Äôve been diving deep into cybersecurity, privacy, and digital forensics.

I didn‚Äôt come from a CS degree or bootcamp. What I *do* have is hands-on experience, persistence, and a relentless curiosity that‚Äôs led me to build and break things across multiple platforms ‚Äî not because someone told me to, but because I had to know what was real.

This is a running log of what I‚Äôve hardened, investigated, and learned ‚Äî from network forensics to OSINT to CLI discipline ‚Äî all self-taught, thoroughly documented, and still evolving.

## üîê Device Hardening Projects

### iPhone (iOS 17/18)
- Disabled telemetry, ads, and iCloud sync for sensitive data  
- Configured **NextDNS** + **ProtonVPN**  
- Used **Brave** with fingerprinting protection  
- Audited and removed unauthorized iCloud access  

### Pixel 6 / Pixel 6 Pro (Android 14)
- Factory reset and rebuilt from scratch using FOSS tools  
- Set up **Shizuku** with wireless debugging  
- Installed **RethinkDNS**, **Aurora Store**, **AppManager**  
- Blocked background telemetry and hardened firewall  

### MacBook Pro (M4) & Mac Mini (M2)
- Hardened macOS with:
  - **NextDNS CLI** + **Mullvad VPN**  
  - **Malwarebytes Endpoint Protection**  
  - Custom **PF firewall rules**  
- Resolved iCloud lockouts and SIP restrictions  

### 2015 iMac (Intel)
- Cleaned degraded performance and keychain bugs  
- Installed **Homebrew**, **NextDNS CLI**, removed launch agents  
- Hardened while preserving Zoom functionality

## üïµÔ∏è From Curiosity to Investigation: OSINT & Digital Forensics

This started with a personal investigation that required hard evidence ‚Äî not theories, not gut feelings. I had to learn how to extract truth from data. Along the way, I unknowingly began doing real OSINT and forensic work.

- Cross-referenced aliases via public records sites  
- Verified photo locations via maps and timestamps  
- Recovered deleted content with **PhoneRescue**, ADB, and other tools  
- Extracted and compared **Google Takeout**, iCloud, Maps, YouTube, Chrome, and Messages data  
- Used the **Wayback Machine** to analyze removed or altered pages  
- Discovered how sites behave differently based on device/browser/fingerprint  

Things I thought were ‚Äúquirks‚Äù turned out to be real techniques used in surveillance and red teaming ‚Äî from screen resolution detection to abusive Android accessibility tools.

Now I‚Äôm giving those discoveries structure and language.

## üß∞ Tools I Used (Before I Knew What I Was Doing)

- **SnapWonders** for image metadata and hidden data  
- Massive use of screenshots and screen recordings to reconstruct timelines  
- Developer tools in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari (Inspect, WebView behavior)  
- Timeline reconstruction across messaging platforms  
- Manual cross-checking of web history, photos, and chat logs  
- Discovered site redirection/facade behaviors based on access method

## üéß Audio & Video Forensics

Blending music production skills with investigative work:

- Used **Logic Pro** and **Ableton Live** to isolate and clean audio  
- Separated speech, background noise, and environmental context  
- Synced surveillance audio/video (e.g., Roku, SimpliSafe) to messages, photos, and logs

## ‚å®Ô∏è CLI Practice & Typing Discipline

- Daily practice with **Keybr** and **Monkeytype**  
- Focus on finger discipline over speed  
- Comfortable in `zsh` on macOS  
- Learned basics of `chmod`, `chown`, `ls`, `mv`, flags/options

## üöß What I‚Äôm Learning Next

- **Python** for scripting and automation  
- **Linux** fundamentals and shell scripting  
- Studying for **CompTIA A+**, **Security+**, maybe **Network+**  
- Exploring **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**  
- Expanding formal skills in **phishing analysis** and **threat modeling**
